# alphaShape
Matlab implementation of the alpha shape in n-dimensions. Finds the concave hull of a point cloud for a given alpha, or the convex hull as alpha -> infinity.

Implementation of the naive alpha shape generation found in https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs268-11-spring/handouts/AlphaShapes/as_fisher.pdf

Visualisation included for 2D and 3D point sets.

Should work for n-dimensional sets

Not written for efficiency
